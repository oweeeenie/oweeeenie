Hey! My names Owen, I am from Ohio and I am a self taught developer. I started learning code in 2024 of April and have been learning ever since. I followed the traditonal front-end route by learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

As time has went on, I also decided to pickup some other important languages/frameworks. That being, React and TypeScript. I am interested in becoming a front-end-developer as of right now just to get my foot in the door, and will gladly branch out to other things like back-end.. etc...

I love working alongside like-minded people and have a huge passion for web development as it's not only a hobby, but could be a career! Learning is what drives me to keep going.

What do I do?
